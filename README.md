# Data-Analysis-No-show-appointments-from-kaggle-
This the first project in Data Analyst - ALX-T nanodgree program from Udacity

We began investigating the data analysis process in this project.
As a dataset, we used the No-show-appointments from Kaggle.

This is the table of conntent of my notebook: 
- Introduction
- Data Wrangling
- Exploratory Data Analysis
- Conclusions


The dataset used  collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. and we will try to respond to those questions: 

1) Is scholarship associated with higher show rate?
2) Are the females more committed to attending appointment?
3) Does disease affect appointment show rate ?
